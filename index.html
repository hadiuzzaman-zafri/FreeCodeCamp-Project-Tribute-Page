            <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Muhammad Ali's life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>1942</strong>
                  - Cassius Clay, Jr. is born to Odessa and Cassius Clay, Sr. at the Louisville General Hospital
                  in South Louisville. Two years later, brother Rudy (later Rahaman Ali) is born, and soon
                  the family moves into the Parkland neighborhood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1954</strong>
                    - The red Schwinn bike of twelve-year-old Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay, Jr.) is stolen
                    outside the annual Louisville Home Show. Reporting the theft to nearby policeman Joe
                    Martin, he expresses a desire to “whup” the culprit. Martin—who trains young
                    boxers—suggests he should first learn how to fight. (Spoiler alert: advice taken.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1957</strong>
                    - Cassius struggles academically (he was later diagnosed with dyslexia) but becomes a
                    school celebrity for his dedication to training, including running to school every day
                    alongside the bus. He would visit the school as a hero after the Rome Olympic Games and
                    his legacy remains a point of Central pride.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1960</strong>
                    - Three months out of high school, Ali competes at the 1960
                    Summer Olympics in Rome. Despite being afraid of
                    airplanes, Ali boards the flight while wearing an army
                    surplus parachute. He wins the light-heavyweight gold
                    medal, defeating Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1962</strong>
                    - Clay’s early boxing years are also formative ones in his spiritual journeys, headlined by
                    meeting Malcolm X in Detroit in 1962, and Drew Bundini Brown in the spring of 1963.
                    Training with Angelo Dundee at 5th Street Gym in Miami, Cassius is poised for the next
                    level, carrying 19 straight wins into his first shot at the heavyweight championship.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1964</strong>
                    - In his first heavyweight title bout, Ali is a longshot to defeat
                    Liston, widely seen as unstoppable. Nonetheless, Ali
                    predicts “a total eclipse of the Sonny”—and indeed Liston
                    does not rise to the seventh round’s opening bell. “I’m the
                    greatest! I shook up the world!”
                    Win - Technical Knockout in 6 rounds [Miami Beach]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1964</strong>
                    - The day after winning his first heavyweight belt, the fighter announces he is a proud
                    Muslim. He goes by the name Cassius X for nine days, then receives the new name of
                    Muhammad Ali from Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1964</strong>
                    - Visiting Ghana, Nigeria, and Egypt, Ali inspires as a symbol of anti-colonialism. Welcomed
                    in Ghana as a son of Africa and a hero, Ali reclaims his roots by saying “I am an African.” At
                    the pyramids in Cairo, the BBC reports he “fuse[s] politics and religion” when giving the
                    Black power salute and shouting ‘God is great’ in Arabic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1967</strong>
                    - Ali twice refuses to step forward when military induction officials call his name, citing his
                    conscientious objection to the war in Vietnam as a minister in the non-violent religion of
                    Islam. Convicted of draft evasion, he is stripped of his heavyweight title and boxing
                    licenses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1970</strong>
                    - This fight was not approved by Georgia governor Lester Maddox, a segregationist who
                    declared a “day of mourning” over it. However, only Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell’s approval
                    was necessary, secured through the efforts of State Senator Leroy Johnson. Ali previewed
                    the fight in a drawing to Leroy Nieman, where Maddox is drawn running down the back
                    right aisle, yelling "Stop that fight!"
                    Win - Technical Knockout in 3 rounds [Atlanta, Georgia]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1971</strong>
                    - In a chance to reclaim his title, Ali’s first heavyweight fight with Frazier matched two
                    undefeated fighters. However, Ali’s three years away from the ring made the difference in
                    a grueling 15 rounds. It is Ali’s first defeat and the start of the greatest rivalry in boxing
                    history.
                    Loss - Unanimous Decision in 15 rounds [New York City]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1972</strong>
                    - With his passport returned by the Supreme Court decision, Ali travels to Saudi Arabia to
                    perform Hajj for the first time. Ali observes ihrām—a sacred state of cleansing and
                    attire—as he approaches Mecca. While there, Ali also meets with the royal family.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1974</strong>
                    - Although Joe Frazier no longer held the title of Heavyweight Champion, Muhammad Ali
                    wanted to face him again to prove he was indeed “the Greatest.” Billed as “Super Fight II,”
                    the match went the distance of 12 rounds and ultimately led to a unanimous decision in
                    favor of Ali.
                    Win - Unanimous Decision in 12 rounds [New York City]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1974</strong>
                    A showdown in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the
Congo) to reclaim Ali's heavyweight title puts him against
Foreman, the imposing favorite. Ali employs his
“rope-a-dope” tactic: leaning on the ropes, Ali absorbs
body blows until Foreman finally wears himself out. The
fight held cultural impact for the people of Zaire, who
connected with Ali, as well as the millions who watched the
fight around the world.
Win - Knockout in 8 rounds [Kinshasa, Zaire]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1975</strong>
                    - Ali meets Frazier in the final installment of this storied
                    boxing rivalry, and one of the most grueling but best
                    displays of the sport. It was the fight Ali said was the closest
                    he's ever been to dying. Both fighters faded fast toward the
                    end, but it was Frazier’s corner who conceded in round 14.
                    Win - Technical Knockout in 14 rounds [Quezon City,
                    Philippines]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1978</strong>
                    - Ali’s self-appointed title of “The Greatest” is solidified in a
                    Spinks rematch at The Superdome in New Orleans. The
                    event has the then-highest attendance ever for an indoor
                    bout. Ali takes the world heavyweight championship for a
                    third time—a first in boxing history.
                    Win - Unanimous Decision in 15 rounds [New Orleans,
                    Louisiana]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1981</strong>
                    - Ali hears of a distressed man threatening to jump from a ninth-floor window and races his
                    car to the scene. He talks the man down from the ledge by saying, “You’re my brother. I
                    love you.” Checking the man into a local hospital, Ali returns later to check on his
                    progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1981</strong>
                    - In the 61st and final fight of his career, Muhammad Ali begins the bout trying to look like
                    his former self, but by the sixth round, he began to tire. After Berbick was declared winner,
                    Ali officially retired.
                    Loss - Unanimous Decision in 10 rounds [Nassau, Bahamas]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1984</strong>
                    - Since retiring, Ali's health had intensely deteriorated. After checking himself into New
                    York’s Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, Ali is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a brain
                    disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, difficulty walking, and loss of balance and
                    coordination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1990</strong>
                    - Despite warnings, Ali travels to Baghdad, Iraq to negotiate
                    the release of 15 United States hostages taken during the
                    Kuwait invasion. Ali meets with Saddam Hussein for nearly
                    an hour and successfully secures the hostages’ release.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2005</strong>
                    - President George W. Bush awards Ali with the highest civilian honor in the United States:
                    “Across the world, billions of people know Muhammad Ali as a brave, compassionate and
                    charming man, and the American people are proud to call Muhammad Ali one of our
                    own.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2013</strong>
                    - These annual awards honor and celebrate individuals who, like Muhammad Ali, have
                    devoted their lives to peace and social justice, inspiring others to do great things in their
                    communities. Inaugural honorees include President Jimmy Carter and Christina Aguilera.
